# Loan-Default-Predictor

## Overview

The Loan Default Predictor is a powerful machine learning tool designed to assess the risk of loan default for borrowers. It leverages cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, including scikit-learn and LightGBM, to provide accurate predictions of whether a borrower is likely to default on their loan. This project aims to assist financial institutions, lenders, and individuals in making informed decisions regarding loans.

## Key Features

### 1. scikit-learn Integration

Scikit-learn is a versatile machine learning library that offers a wide range of tools for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. In this project, we have seamlessly integrated scikit-learn to ensure robust data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation. This integration allows us to create a reliable and accurate loan default prediction model.

### 2. LightGBM Model

LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that is renowned for its efficiency and performance. Our project harnesses the capabilities of LightGBM to build a high-quality predictive model. With its speed and accuracy, LightGBM ensures that our loan default predictions are both fast and reliable.

## Dataset

To train and evaluate our loan default prediction model, we use a curated dataset containing historical loan information. This dataset includes a wide range of features related to borrowers' financial profiles, loan terms, and previous loan performance. By using this dataset, we ensure that our model is built on real-world, relevant data.
